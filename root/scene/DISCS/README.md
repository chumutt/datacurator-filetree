## Scene Rules / Naming



**SIR** (Standard ISO Rules)

```
TBD
```



**BDR** (= BluRay reencoded)

> This is not a 1:1 copy! It's a modified encode, because the scene requires BD-R releases to fit on a 25 GB single-layer Blu-ray Disc.

```
Movie.Name.YEAR.<PROPER/READ.NFO/REPACK>.<MULTi/SUBS/REGiON>.BDR-GROUP
TV.Show.SxxDxx.<PROPER/READ.NFO/REPACK>.<MULTi/SUBS/REGiON>.BDR-GROUP
Music.YEAR.<PROPER/READ.NFO/REPACK>.<MULTi/SUBS/REGiON>.MBDR-GROUP

# Language Tags || Region Tags
MULTiSUBS/MULTi/NL/NORDiC/iTALiAN/etc || R1/R2/R3

# Multi-Disc Naming
DiSC1, DiSC2, DiSC3
```



**BLURAY**

> 1:1 copies of retail bluray discs

```
Movie.Name.YEAR.<PROPER/READ.NFO/REPACK>.<MULTi/SUBS/REGiON>.COMPLETE.BLURAY-GROUP
TV.Show.SxxDxx.<PROPER/READ.NFO/REPACK>.<MULTi/SUBS/REGiON>.COMPLETE.BLURAY-GROUP
Music.YEAR.<PROPER/READ.NFO/REPACK>.<MULTi/SUBS/REGiON>.COMPLETE.MBLURAY-GROUP

# Language Tags || Region Tags
MULTiSUBS/MULTi/NL/NORDiC/iTALiAN/etc || A/B/C

# Multi-Disc Naming
DiSC1, DiSC2, DiSC3
```



**DVDR** (= DVD reencoded)

> This is not always a 1:1 copy! It may be a modified encode, because the scene requires DVD-Video releases to fit on a 4.7 GB DVD-R. Although there seems to be some addendum, which allowed for `COMPLETE` Releases if only the warnings had been removed, especially after DVD9 became a thing.

```
# Naming
MOVIE.TITLE.DVDR-GROUP
MOVIE.TITLE.REGION.STANDARD.DVDR-GROUP
MOVIE.TITLE.EXTENDED.EDITION.DiSC1.STANDARD.DVDR-GROUP

# COMPLETE Variant
MOVIE.TITLE.<EDITION>.<DiSC#>.<NTSC|PAL>.COMPLETE.<DVDR|DVD9>-GROUP


# Format
.img / .iso
```



**MDVDR** (= Music DVD reencoded)

> Same as DVDR, but for Music.

```
MOVIE.TITLE.YEAR.OTHERS.SOURCES.REGION.MDVDR-GROU
```
